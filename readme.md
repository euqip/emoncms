# Emoncms 8

# Installation on Linux

## Install dependencies

You may need to start by updating the system repositories

    sudo apt-get update

Install all dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server mysql-client php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php-pear php5-dev php5-mcrypt git-core redis-server build-essential ufw ntp

Install pecl dependencies (serial, redis and swift mailer)

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.swiftmailer.org
    sudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/dio-0.0.6 redis swift/swift
    
Add pecl modules to php5 config
    
    sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=dio.so" > /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/20-dio.ini'
    sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=dio.so" > /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/20-dio.ini'
    sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=redis.so" > /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/20-redis.ini'
    sudo sh -c 'echo "extension=redis.so" > /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/20-redis.ini'

### Enable mod rewrite

Emoncms uses a front controller to route requests, modrewrite needs to be configured:

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

Change (line 7 and line 11), "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All".
That is the sections <Directory /> and <Directory /var/www/>.
[Ctrl + X ] then [Y] then [Enter] to Save and exit.

Restart the lamp server:

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    
### Install the emoncms application via git

Git is a source code management and revision control system but at this stage we use it to just download and update the emoncms application.

First cd into the var directory:

    $ cd /var/

Set the permissions of the www directory to be owned by your username:

    $ sudo chown $USER www

Cd into www directory

    $ cd www

Download emoncms using git:

    $ git clone -b rework https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms.git
    
Once installed you can pull in updates with:

    git pull
    
### Create a MYSQL database

    $ mysql -u root -p

Enter the mysql password that you set above.
Then enter the sql to create a database:

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE emoncms;

Exit mysql by:

    mysql> exit
    
## Create data repositories for emoncms feed engine's

    sudo mkdir /var/lib/phpfiwa
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/phpfina
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/phptimeseries

    sudo chown www-data:root /var/lib/phpfiwa
    sudo chown www-data:root /var/lib/phpfina
    sudo chown www-data:root /var/lib/phptimeseries

### Set emoncms database settings.

cd into the emoncms directory where the settings file is located

    $ cd /var/www/emoncms/

Make a copy of default.settings.php and call it settings.php

    $ cp default.settings.php settings.php

Open settings.php in an editor:

    $ nano settings.php

Enter in your database settings.

    $username = "USERNAME";
    $password = "PASSWORD";
    $server   = "localhost";
    $database = "emoncms";

Save (Ctrl-X), type Y and exit

### Install add-on emoncms modules

Install additional modules:
    
    cd /var/www/emoncms/Modules
    
    git clone -b redismetadata https://github.com/emoncms/raspberrypi.git
    git clone -b redismetadata https://github.com/emoncms/event.git
    git clone https://github.com/emoncms/openbem.git
    git clone https://github.com/emoncms/energy.git
    git clone https://github.com/emoncms/notify.git
    git clone https://github.com/emoncms/report.git
    git clone https://github.com/emoncms/packetgen.git
    git clone https://github.com/elyobelyob/mqtt.git
 
See individual module readme's for further information on individual module installation.

# Shared Linux Hosting

Your shared hosting provider should already have a LAMP server installed. You may need to ask your hosting provider to enable mod_rewrite. It's unlikely that redis will be available (redis is used to improve performance through caching), but emoncms can be run without it.

To install emoncms on a shared server

1) Download the (currently rework branch) zip file from:

[https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/archive/rework.zip]([https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/archive/rework.zip])

Unzip to your shared server's public_html folder, rename the folder to emoncms.

2) Create a mysql database for your emoncms installation, note down its name, username and password.

3) In your shared hosting /home/username folder create a folder called emoncmsdata to hold your emoncms feed data. (Note: NOT public_html as the data files should not be publicly accessible).
Then create three folders within your emoncmsdata folder called: phpfiwa, phpfina and phptimeseries

4) In the emoncms app directory make a copy of default_settings.php and call it settings.php. Open settings.php and enter your mysql username, password and database. In the feed_settings section uncomment the datadir defenitions and set them to the location of each of the feed engine data folders on your system.

5) Thats it, emoncms should now be ready to use!
